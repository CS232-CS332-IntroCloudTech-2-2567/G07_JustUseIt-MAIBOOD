MaiBood is a web-based platform designed to minimize food waste by enabling individuals to buy and sell unused or surplus groceriesâ€”such as fresh produce, packaged goods, or leftover ingredients. The system encourages sustainability and promotes community-driven resource sharing. Users can upload images of their available food items, set prices, search for nearby goods, and interact with a localized food-sharing ecosystem.
